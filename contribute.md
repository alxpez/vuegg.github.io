### Current state & history

The project was born as a sandbox for me to get started on the [vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) world, in fact its ~~un~~original name was vuexample (*very unique*, I thought at the time).

Not long after it became a personal challenge, I went on adding new features (mainly things I feel like learning) and gave it a proper name (and even a *face*). Eventually I considered it to be ready for the open-source community... and here is *vuegg*, my pet project.
